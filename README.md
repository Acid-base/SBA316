To-Do List App
This is a simple to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, delete, complete, and reorder tasks. Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the browser is closed.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks with a description and category.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.
Mark Tasks as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete by clicking the "Complete" button. Completed tasks are visually indicated with a line-through.
Reorder Tasks: Users can reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them.
Clear All Tasks: Users can clear all tasks from the list.
Local Storage: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the browser is closed.
Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone <https://github.com/your-username/to-do-list.git>

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling the web page.
JavaScript: For handling user interactions and data manipulation.
Local Storage: For storing task data persistently.
Development Challenges
During development, we encountered a few challenges:

Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC): The browser would render the page before the stylesheet was fully loaded, resulting in a brief moment of unstyled content. We resolved this by ensuring the stylesheet was loaded in the <head> section of the HTML file.
Source Map Errors: We encountered errors related to source maps, which are used for debugging. These errors were not critical to the application's functionality and were resolved by ensuring source maps were correctly configured in our development tools.
DOMTokenList.add Error: We encountered an error when trying to add a class to a DOM element. This was due to an issue with how we were handling the category of tasks when loading them from local storage. We fixed this by ensuring that a default category was always provided if the category was missing.
Drag and Drop Implementation: Implementing drag and drop functionality required careful handling of event listeners and updating the task order in local storage. We had to ensure that the task order was consistent across the DOM and the local storage data.
Future Improvements
Add Task Editing: Allow users to edit existing tasks.
Filter Tasks: Implement filtering options to view tasks by category or completion status.
Search Functionality: Add a search bar to quickly find specific tasks.
Date/Time Tracking: Allow users to set deadlines or due dates for tasks.
Notifications: Implement notifications to remind users about upcoming deadlines.
